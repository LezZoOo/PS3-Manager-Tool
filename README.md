# PS3 Manager Tool

A tool with a lot of options. I have included everything..
There are system options obviously, but mainly there are downloads to Homebrew, CFWs, Tools, Mods, Games etc..
It's something like a big DataBase. You can find links to games and DLCs, those ones that i could find.

You can improve it, adding links or whatever you want.
You will need Visual Studio with the .NET functions and DX 16.2 or later to open and compile it.
